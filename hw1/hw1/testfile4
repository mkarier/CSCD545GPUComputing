read in: propaganda is a concerted set of messages aimed at influencing the opinions or behavior of large numbers of people. instead of impartially providing information, propaganda in its most basic sense presents information in order to influence its audience. the most effective propaganda is often completely truthful, but some propaganda presents facts selectively to encourage a particular synthesis, or gives loaded messages in order to produce an emotional rather than rational response to the information presented. the desired result is a change of the cognitive narrative of the subject in the target audience.
